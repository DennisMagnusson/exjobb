# High Resolution Image Quality Enhancement


This is the repository containing the code and methods used for my master's thesis project.

To train the models, first download the datasets. Then train the CUT and Real-ESRGAN models using the training scripts in their corresponding repositories. Use the `eval.py` script to evaluate the results.
